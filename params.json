So you can only install it on a developer phone. You need to [enable remote debugging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Developer_settings#Remote_debugging) on your phone.\r\n\r\nTo push the application to the phone, I [push it from the Firefox OS Simulator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Firefox_OS_Simulator#Push_to_device).\r\n\r\n** Current status of debugging certified applications **\r\n\r\n - Simulator seems [broken with 1.2 and 1.3](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=928527) so you won’t be able to use it to push the application to your device ;\r\n - to use the new App Manager, you need a [development build of Firefox OS 1.2](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Using_the_App_Manager#Debugging_Certified_Apps) ;\r\n\r\nFurthermore, [“the marketplace can not distribute apps that use certified APIs”](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.marketplace/vY3Rj3tWXuU). That’s a sad news, because it means that this application will only be available to developers.\r\n\r\nTo create the package, use \r\n\r\n    rm stumbler.zip && zip -r stumbler.zip index.html js locales manifest.webapp style\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting GeoLocation\r\n\r\nOn my Keon, geolocation seems very inaccurate. So I added the ability to select current location on a card with a custom Web Activity. To use it, you need to install another application which implements `clochix.geoloc` Web Activity (see my [hereIam](https://github.com/clochix/hereIam) application) and check the \"Ask\" radio button. In this mode, monitoring of position changes is currently disabled;\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
