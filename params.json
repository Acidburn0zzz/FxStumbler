{"name":"Fxstumbler","tagline":"Firefox OS Stumbler for Mozilla http://location.services.mozilla.com","body":"# FxStumbler\r\n\r\nFirefox OS client for [Mozilla Location Service](http://location.services.mozilla.com).\r\n\r\nThis application uses phone APIs only available to certified apps for the moment ([WifiManager](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WifiManager), [MobileConnection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MozMobileConnection)) . So you can only install it on a developer phone. You need to [enable remote debugging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Developer_settings#Remote_debugging) on your phone.\r\n\r\nTo push the application to the phone, you can use the [Firefox OS Simulator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Firefox_OS_Simulator#Push_to_device) or the [App Manager](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Using_the_App_Manager).\r\n\r\nWhen cloning the repository, don’t forget to update submodules:\r\n\r\n    git submodules init\r\n    git submodules update\r\n\r\n** Current status of debugging certified applications **\r\n\r\n - Simulator seems [broken with 1.2 and 1.3](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=928527) so you won’t be able to use it to push the application to your device ;\r\n - to use the new App Manager, you need a [development build of Firefox OS 1.2](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Using_the_App_Manager#Debugging_Certified_Apps) ;\r\n\r\nFurthermore, [“the marketplace can not distribute apps that use certified APIs”](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.marketplace/vY3Rj3tWXuU). That’s a sad news, because it means that this application will only be available to developers.\r\n\r\nTo create the package, use \r\n\r\n    rm stumbler.zip && zip -r stumbler.zip index.html js locales manifest.webapp style\r\n\r\nOr just `make all`\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Main actions\r\n\r\n - *Push infos*: get current location, cell and Wifi informations and perform the action selected in the options (default is to push to the Web service);\r\n - *Start Monitoring*: perform the above action every time location or mobile cell information change;\r\n - *Get my position* query the Web service to get current position according to mobile cells and wifi networks nearby;\r\n - *Clear log*: clear the log window;\r\n\r\n### Storage options\r\n\r\nCollected information can by stored in a local database and sent to the server later. You can display the full content of the database (warning, a huge JSON array), send it or clear all records.\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n\r\n - *Geoloc*: how to get current location: GPS or by using another app;\r\n - *Action*: send data immediately, store them in local database or do nothing;\r\n - *Username*: if you want your name in the [hall of fame](https://location.services.mozilla.com/leaders);\r\n - geoloc: allow to fine tune [geolocation options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PositionOptions);\r\n - min accuracy: data will be ignored if accuracy of geoloc is more than this value (aka if geoloc is not accurate enough);\r\n - min distance: when watching position change, will only store new data if distance from previous measure is more than this value, in meter, or if accuracy is 20% better;\r\n - *Log level*: verbosity of logs;\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting GeoLocation\r\n\r\nOn my Keon, geolocation seems very inaccurate. So I added the ability to select current location on a map with a custom Web Activity. To use it, you need to install another application which implements `clochix.geoloc` Web Activity (see my [hereIam](https://github.com/clochix/hereIam) application) and check the \"Ask\" radio button. In this mode, monitoring of position changes is currently disabled;\r\n\r\n## Release notes\r\n\r\n* [2014-01-19]\r\n  - use bigger buttons;\r\n  - add options: minimal accuracy and minimal distance between 2 measures;\r\n  - options should be saved;\r\n  - logs are now hidden by default;\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
